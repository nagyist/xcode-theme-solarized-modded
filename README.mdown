## Solarized Dark, @steipete mod

Over the years I found the perfect theme for working with Xcode.
It's based on the excellent solarized themeset: https://github.com/altercation/solarized

Font is Meslo DZ, a customized version of Appleâ€™s Menlo-Regular font. (Apache v2 licensed)

Installation
------------
Copy the .dvtcolortheme files from this directory into ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/UserData/FontAndColorThemes - you may have to make this folder if you haven't changed your color themes. Restart Xcode, select new Theme in Color settings. That's it.

Cursor
------

This is a nice complement to tweak the cursor in dark mode:
